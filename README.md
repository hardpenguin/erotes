# Erotes

**Erotes** is a [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/) (love2d) project manager on Linux. It is meant to manage:

- creating an empty project template using chosen LÖVE version
- running the development version of the project
- exporting the project to .love file as well as Linux and Windows executable format

## Usage

```
Syntax:
 erotes [options]

Available options:
  -s,    --start               starts the new project                  
  -r,    --run                 runs the project currently in development
  -e,    --export              exports the currently developed project 
```

To build the project you also need [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/). It has to be installed using pip:

```pip install pyinstaller```
