# Erotes

**Erotes** is a [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/) (love2d) project manager on Linux. It is meant to manage:

- creating an empty project template using chosen LÖVE version
- running the development version of the project
- exporting the project to Linux and Windows executable format

#### Disclaimer
It's work in progress, needs better documentation and new features will pop up hopefully in the future.
